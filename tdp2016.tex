\begin{abstract}
CIT Brains @Home has been newly set up in November 2016
as a derivational team from the world-champion team
in the humanoid league and from a team that participates in
an outdoor mobile robot competition in Japan.
Through participation in @Home league,
we contribute actively to the study of natural decision making
in home environments and to packaging of our past/future
software/hardware as reusable and open ones.

\section{The aim of the team}

CIT Brains @Home has been newly set up in November 2016
by the staff and students in Department of Advanced Robotics,
Chiba Institute of Technology.
The aim of this team is integration of research progresses
in our department.

\section{Robot}
The robot, which has no name, is mainly composed of a commercial mobile robot,
two self-produced manipulators.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Hardware}
\subsubsection{Mobile robot part}

We use i-Cart mini\cite{icartmini} as a mobile robot part
with some modifications. In our department, 
this robot is also used for Tsukuba Challenge,
which is an annual competition on outdoor navigation of mobile robots
held in Japan.
Our customized robot from i-Cart mini is named ORNE
(ORNE for Robot Navigation Engineers).

Though the motors are very silent, 
they have an ability to make the robot move on public streets.
This mobile robot has two drive wheels whose diameter are 155[mm], 
and one rear caster whose diameter is 100[mm].
Each of the drive wheel is connected to a slient brushless motor.

Under the front bumper, an UTM-30LX-EW Scanning range finder
is attached for navigation.
A Microsoft Kinect at the top of the robot is used for
detecting and following persons.


\subsubsection{Manipulator part}

The robot has two manipulators, which are called arms hereafter.
Each arm has

	\end{center}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

Two kinds of hand are attached to
the manipulators respectively.

\subsubsection{Cover of the robot} We have never been prepared.

\subsection{Software}

Figure~\ref{fig:rqt_graph} shows the structure of software.
The robot operating system (ROS) used as the framework of our software.
Since we need to construct software in short term, 
we have reused nodes for Tsukuba Challenge (modules named
\texttt{orne\_...} in the figure).
The software for Tsukuba Challenge also contain open source nodes
(\texttt{move\_base,amcl...}) and nodes for i-Cart mini (\texttt{icart\_...}).

These reused nodes are controlled by
\texttt{orne\_navigation\_task\_strategy},
which is a simple Python script.

\section{Innovative technology and scientific contribution}

Our basic idea to realize home-care robots is that they
should try something even if they have certain information
what they should do. Some mistakes will occur when the robot
acts without certain information.
However, a decision making rule that permits mistakes will make
a robot accomplish more tasks than another rule that waits for
perfect information.

We also think that decision making with this loose policy
will generate a natural communication between a robot and its owners.
For example, a person want to eat cookies
with a high probability when the owner asks his/her robot to bring cookies.
However, there is some some possibility that the owner

\section{Externally available components}

We have developed a ROS module for servo motors made
by Kondo Kagaku Co., Ltd.
as our first contribution\cite{hayashibara_kondo}.
We will publish our software through GitHub.
